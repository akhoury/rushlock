chrome extension foe ma /h - lowers your caRps

instructions:

 * Download the zip file, extract it to a safe directory
 * Open Google chrome, settings (that wrench icon on the top right), extensions
 * Tick the 'Developer mode' (since this extension is not on the market)
 * Load unpacked extensions
 * Find the 'rushlock' directory, select it and voila !

Now everything you write in /h will be lower case, no more yelling [period]

Still need more work to handle the @NAME LASTNAME shit in facebook
